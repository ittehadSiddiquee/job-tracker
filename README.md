Answers to Questions
1. Difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector?

getElementById: Selects a single element by its unique ID. It is the fastest method.
getElementsByClassName: Returns a live HTMLCollection of all elements with a specific class.
querySelector: A versatile tool that selects the first element matching a CSS selector (ID, class, or tag).
querySelectorAll: Selects all matching elements and returns them as a static NodeList.
2. How to create and insert a new element into the DOM?

First, we create an element using document.createElement('tagName'). Then, we can add content using innerText or innerHTML. Finally, we insert it into the DOM using appendChild() (to add it as the last child) or insertBefore() (to place it before a specific element).

3. What is Event Bubbling?

Event Bubbling is a way of event propagation in the HTML DOM. When an event happens on an element (like a button click), the event first runs on the button, then bubbles up to its parent, then to the grandparent, and so on, until it reaches the window object.

4. What is Event Delegation and why is it useful?

Event Delegation is a technique where we add a single event listener to a parent element instead of adding multiple listeners to every child. It is useful because it saves memory and works perfectly for dynamic elements that are added to the UI later.

5. difference between preventDefault() and stopPropagation()?

preventDefault(): Stops the default browser behavior of an element (like preventing a link from opening or a form from refreshing).
stopPropagation(): Stops the event from bubbling up to parent elements, preventing their event listeners from firing.
